This error occurs when using the `useCallback` hook in React Native with a function that depends on a value from `useState` or another state management solution.  The problem arises when the dependency array of `useCallback` omits the state value, causing the callback to remain unchanged even when the state value updates. This leads to unexpected behavior where the component doesn't re-render or update correctly, despite state changes.
