This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using the `useCallback` hook in React Native. The `StaleClosureBug.js` file shows how omitting a dependency from the `useCallback` hook leads to stale closures, preventing the component from re-rendering when the state changes. The solution, provided in `StaleClosureSolution.js`, showcases how to correctly include the state value in the dependency array to fix this issue.  This results in the expected component re-renders and behavior.
